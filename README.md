Explore weight loss discussions and sentiments on Reddit

# Overview
This study investigates the weight loss discussions and sentiments on Reddit during the COVID-19
pandemic. This study collected and analyzed a dataset containing 35,384 posts from March 2019 to March
2021 in the loseit subreddit. To compare and explore how discussions and sentiments changed within this
weight loss subreddit, the analysis utilized two unsupervised machine learning methods, topic modeling
and sentiment analysis, to explore the evolution of the topics and emotional expressions of weight loss
discussions over time. By employing topic modeling (LDA), the study identified 16 topics within five
categories of weight loss discussions: Weight Management, Diet, Physical Exercise, Emotions and Support,
and Appearance. However, topic related weight loss as well as upstream and downstream such as Weight
change (T2), Calorie tracker (T3), Motivation (T4) and Workout plan (T15) varied over time. Furthermore,
Sentiment analysis indicated that discussions in the loseit subreddit are mainly positive rather than negative.
There was a slight increase in negative sentiments and a decrease in positive throughout the study period.
Emotion analysis indicates the complexity of the emotion dynamic in weight loss discussions. Moreover,
users in this weight loss subreddit frequently expressed positive emotions, such as anticipation, and negative
emotions, such as fear. However, the sentiments and emotions varied significantly among most topics.
These findings reveal how social media affected netizens' attitudes and behaviour on this topic and how it
changed during this global crisis. While the study noted significant sentiment changes in some topics across
the two time periods in this weight loss subreddit, it remains cautious about concluding the impact of the
pandemic in weight loss discussion on social media. Further study could explore a more extended period
in multiple subreddits or social media platforms to conclusively link these trends with the pandemic's effect.
